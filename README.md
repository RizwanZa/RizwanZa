I began figuring out how to code when I was a teenager, however it was always more of a hobby than a career. After an advanced degree in Computer Science, and proceeding to seek after that side interest, I understood programming was the right field for me. From that point forward, I've chipped away at innumerable freelance projects and have been engaged with a small bunch of prominent startups.
